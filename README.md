# Music Recommendation through K-means Clustering
### Description
This project explores the clustering of songs based on their features to recommend similar songs. We utilize the Spotify 2023 dataset, which provides various attributes for songs. The primary objective is to understand the inherent structure of the data and group songs that are alike. These clusters then serve as a foundation for a recommendation system.


### Setup and Installation

#### Clone the repository:

```python
git clone <repository_url>
```

#### Navigate to the project directory:
```python
cd music-recommendation-clustering
```

#### Install the required packages:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
```python
jupyter notebook notebooks/music_recommendation_clustering.ipynb
```

### File Descriptions
* /data: Contains the dataset used in this project, specifically spotify2023.csv.

* /notebooks: Contains the Jupyter notebook which holds the entire analysis, visualization, and clustering process.

* /src: (If applicable) Contains any additional Python scripts or modules.

* requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required for this project.

* .gitignore: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
Results

Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebook. We identified distinct clusters of songs based on features like tempo, energy, danceability, and more. These clusters can be leveraged to recommend songs with similar characteristics to users.
